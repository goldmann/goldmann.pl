Default configuration is a great place to start with a project. We at JBoss try
to make our link:http://www.jboss.org/projects/[projects] (and
link:http://www.jboss.org/products/[products] too!) usable out-of-box for as
many use cases as we can, but there is no way that one configuration could
satisfy everyone's needs.  For example, we ship 4 flavors of the `standalone.xml`
configuration file with link:http://wildfly.org/[WildFly] since there are so
many different deployment scenarios. But this is still not enough. We need to be able to
tweak it at any point. The `jboss/wildfly` image is not an exception here.

Following the Docker _recreate -- do not modify_ principle we do change the
configuration by creating a new image (in most cases). This allows us to reuse
the images (consider the `jboss/wildfly` image itself).

Of course this is not the only way to modify the WildFly configuration, so
let's iterate over available options.

*Update 24.07.2014*

link:https://twitter.com/bsideup/status/492050173238181888[One of the readers
brought up] that I forgot to mention one great tool:
link:http://augeas.net/[Augeas]. I've link:#_augeas[added it now to the list]
and summary.

== TL;DR;

See link:#_summary[summary].

== Boot time configuration

Using command line parameters (or environment variables) is the simplest way to
modify the default configuration. This does not require rebuilding the image but is
not persistent. Still, in many cases it is the best approach.

There is one obvious limitation: *only a limited set of things
can be modified*. WildFly allows us to customize parameters with the switches for
the `standalone.sh` or `domain.sh` startup scripts. The
link:https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY8/Command+line+parameters[WildFly
documentation] has a great summary of the available options.

=== Command line parameters

With the `jboss/wildfly` image it's easy to use command line parameters. Just
override the default command when launching the container, for example:

----
docker run -it jboss/wildfly /opt/wildfly/bin/domain.sh -b 0.0.0.0 -Djboss.management.http.port=8888
----

This launches WildFly in
link:https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY8/Operating+modes[domain
mode] (instead of standalone), binds the public endpoint to every
interface, and exposes the management endpoint on port `8888` (by
default bound to `127.0.0.1`).

NOTE: You can create your own image which overrides only the command to run. Use the `CMD` instruction in `Dockerfile`.

=== Environment variables

Specifying environments variables with Docker is easy too:

----
docker run -it -e JBOSS_LOG_DIR=/opt/wildfly/logs jboss/wildfly
----

And now all logs will be saved to the `/opt/wildfly/logs` directory.

NOTE: You can modify environment variables in Docker images too. Use the `ENV` instruction in `Dockerfile`.

Explore the `--env-file` parameter of `docker run` if you want to set many
environment variables.

== `sed`

NOTE: This example is link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-configuration/tree/master/sed[available on GitHub].

The `sed` command may be used in your `Dockerfile` to modify some (small) parts of
the configuration. Please note that WildFly stores configuration in XML format
so you will need to be careful when using `sed` :)

There are possible use cases for `sed`, for example when you want to disable the coloring on the console:

----
sed -i 's|named-formatter name="COLOR-PATTERN"|named-formatter name="PATTERN"|' /opt/wildfly/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
----

In general no, *I do not recommend* using `sed` because using regular expressions may
be tricky, especially if you're not familiar with them.

== `xmlstarlet`

NOTE: This example is link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-configuration/tree/master/xmlstarlet[available on GitHub].

The `xmlstarlet` tool is a set of commands that can be helpful when interacting
with XML files. In our case one command is especially useful: `xmlstarlet ed`
which is used to modify XML documents.

Let's say we want to change the `root-logger` level to `DEBUG`:

----
xmlstarlet ed -L -u "//*[local-name()='root-logger']/*/@name" -v "DEBUG" /opt/wildfly/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
----

You can place the above in your `Dockerfile` and call it done.

Although `xmlstarlet` is nice at finding (using XPath) and editing attributes
or elements, it's not a great tool to add complex elements. It can become
easily *very verbose*. If you don't trust `sed` but still want to tweak some
elements, use `xmlstarlet` instead!

The `jboss/wildfly` image contains the `xmlstarlet` utility installed by default (as of July 23rd).

== XSLT transformations

NOTE: This example is link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-configuration/tree/master/xslt[available on GitHub].

XSLT transformations are a nice way to execute conditional modifications of the
WildFly application server configuration. The
link:https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/tree/8.1.0.Final/testsuite/integration/src/test/xslt[WildFly
team provides examples of xsl files]. You can use Saxon to execute the transformation:

----
java -jar /usr/share/java/saxon.jar -s:/opt/wildfly/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml -xsl:/opt/wildfly/customization/changeIPAddresses.xsl -o:/opt/wildfly/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml publicIPAddress=0.0.0.0
----

In this example we change the default binding address of the server for public ports.

For more information about using the Saxon utility from the CLI, please refer to
the
link:http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/using-xsl/commandline.html[documentation].

The `jboss/wildfly` image contains the `saxon` package installed by default (as of July 23rd).

== Using `jboss-cli.sh`

NOTE: This example is link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-configuration/tree/master/cli[available on GitHub].

WildFly ships with a powerful CLI. The
link:https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY8/CLI+Recipes[documentation]
contains a few examples of how the CLI can be used. Of course the CLI is
perfect to modify the server configuration.

To be able to modify the configuration the *WildFly server needs to be
running*. Since at the build time of a Docker image based on `jboss/wildfly`
(in most cases) we do not start WildFly, this can be a problem.

One solution is to boot WildFly, execute the CLI commands and shutdown the
server. I used this approach in
link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-configuration/tree/master/cli[my
example]. It adds a new `ExampleMySQLDS` datasource to the server. The main file that does
the job is the
link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-configuration/blob/master/cli/customization/execute.sh[`execute.sh`]
script:

----
#!/bin/bash

JBOSS_HOME=/opt/wildfly
JBOSS_CLI=$JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh
JBOSS_MODE=${1:-"standalone"}
JBOSS_CONFIG=${2:-"$JBOSS_MODE.xml"}

function wait_for_server() {
  until `$JBOSS_CLI -c "ls /deployment" &> /dev/null`; do
    sleep 1
  done
}

echo "=> Starting WildFly server"
$JBOSS_HOME/bin/$JBOSS_MODE.sh -c $JBOSS_CONFIG >dev/null &

echo "=> Waiting for the server to boot"
wait_for_server

echo "=> Executing the commands"
$JBOSS_CLI -c --file=`dirname "$0"`/commands.cli

echo "=> Shutting down WildFly"
if [ "$JBOSS_MODE" = "standalone" ]; then
  $JBOSS_CLI -c ":shutdown"
else
  $JBOSS_CLI -c "/host=*:shutdown"
fi
----

The script is general purpose and can be reused in some other images. It can
modify the configuration for any WildFly operating mode and for any
configuration.

The
link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-configuration/blob/master/cli/customization/commands.cli[`commands.cli`]
file contains commands executed in the CLI.

----
# Mark the commands below to be run as a batch
batch

# Add MySQL driver
/subsystem=datasources/jdbc-driver=mysql:add(driver-name=mysql,driver-module-name=com.mysql.jdbc,driver-xa-datasource-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlXADataSource)

# Add the datasource
data-source add --name=UnifiedPushDS --driver-name=mysql --jndi-name=java:jboss/datasources/ExampleMySQLDS --connection-url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sample?useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8 --user-name=user --password=password --use-ccm=false --max-pool-size=25 --blocking-timeout-wait-millis=5000 --enabled=true

# Execute the batch
run-batch
----

The CLI approach is very powerful and flexible. The only caveat is that WildFly
needs to be running to use the CLI.

== Using custom configuration files

NOTE: This example is link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-configuration/tree/master/custom-file[available on GitHub].

The last approach is to simply maintain a separate configuration file for
WildFly. Just `ADD` your configuration to the
`/opt/wildfly/{standalone|domain}/configuration` directory and override the
default boot command. You can for example remove some subsystems like I did in
the
link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-configuration/tree/master/custom-file[example].

This is the simplest and cleanest approach. This way you have full control over
the configuration at any time. The bad thing is that you need to maintain the
file yourself. If a new version of WildFly will be released -- you need to
manually apply the changes to the configuration.

== Augeas

NOTE: This example is link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-configuration/tree/master/augeas[available on GitHub].

Augeas is a link:http://augeas.net/[general purpose configuration editing
tool]. It has plugins (lenses) for many configuration files. If your file isn't
on link:http://augeas.net/stock_lenses.html[the list] -- don't worry -- you can
use some generic lenses. In our case it'll be the Xml lens.

Augeas builds a tree of the file loaded. Just take a look at the example where
we change the `root-logger` (and `cosnole-handler`) level to `DEBUG`.

----
augtool -LA -e <<EOF
set /augeas/load/Xml/lens Xml.lns
set /augeas/load/Xml/incl[2] /opt/wildfly/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
load
defvar subsystem "/files/opt/wildfly/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml/server/profile/subsystem[#attribute/xmlns='urn:jboss:domain:logging:2.0']"
set $subsystem/console-handler/level/#attribute/name "DEBUG"
set $subsystem/root-logger/level/#attribute/name "DEBUG"
save
EOF
----

It looks like XPath, but is much simpler. In previous exmaple we modified the
attribute but it's easy to add new elements too.  Let's add a `TRACE` log level
for our `pl.goldmann.example` category:

----
set $subsystem/logger[last()+1]/#attribute/category "pl.goldmann.example"
set $subsystem/logger[last()]/level/#attribute/name "TRACE"
----

The first command adds a new `<logger/>` element with `pl.goldmann.example` as
the `category` attribute and the next line adds a new `<level/>` element under
the previously created `<logger/>` and sets the `name` atrtibute to `TRACE`.
Isn't nice?

Augeas is definitely a project worth to become familiar with. Above was just a
tiny example of what it can do.

The `jboss/wildfly` image contains the `augeas` utility installed by default (as of July 24rd).

== Summary

Every approach has pros and cons. Boot time configuration is great if you want
to change some exposed parameters. The `sed` and `xmlstarlet` options are
similar providing a simple way to change some parts of the configuration. But
this is not flexible. XSLT transformations are very powerful, but they require
some amount of work to write the stylesheets properly. The `jboss-cli.sh`
aproach is very good if you don't mind starting and stopping WildFly at the
build time. Maintaining own configuration file at the first glance looks like a
best solution and probably it is in some cases. If you want to do have a
powerful yet simple way of changing the configuration -- use Augeas.

What's your approach?
