Below you can find my latest song I made with [Makul](http://www.myspace.com/mokatimakul) over the last year. We planned to do a song together since a few years, but it always failed because of lack of time.

Finally in April this year we met at Makul's house, had a couple of beers and started the work. This is the output of our work. Melody line and part of beat is Makul's work whereas I arrnged and finished the whole thing. A few days ago the song was mastered.

What do you think?
