Starting and stopping Docker containers is easy with the `docker run` and
`docker {stop|kill}` commands. By default, when the Docker daemon is restarted,
running containers are also restarted. This is a great feature but sometimes
you need more control over the container's lifecycle.

Imagine having a container which is linked to another one. Docker does not
provide any way of specifying which container should be started when or what to do
if a container dies.

== Deployment scenario

Consider this pretty simple deployment:

image:/images/systemd_deployment.png[alt="Deployment example", width="100%"]

When we start such a deployment we need to ensure that the database is started
first, so we can later link it to the WildFly node.

NOTE: The load balancer set up is not part of this guide, but is
shown (along with another WildFly node) using a dotted outline. The
link:http://mod-cluster.jboss.org/[mod_cluster] project may be a good
choice for a load balancer.

We'll use following images to power this setup:

1. +fedora/mariadb+ for the the database
2. a custom image based on +jboss/wildfly+ to run the node

== systemd to the rescue

link:http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/[Systemd] is a system
management daemon which replaced SysV init scripts in Fedora some time ago. The
systemd project provides a very flexible and powerful way to manage services.
This is a really big project and all the various use cases for it make it a bit
hard to understand. Luckily our deployment is very simple to implement in systemd.

To be able to manage a service with systemd we need to create a service file for
it. In our case a service is equal to a running container.

== The `docker-mariadb` service

Let's create a `docker-mariadb.service` file for the database container:

----
[Unit]
Description=MariaDB database
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
User=goldmann
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill mariadb
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm mariadb
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --name=mariadb fedora/mariadb
ExecStop=-/usr/bin/docker stop mariadb

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

This file should be stored in the +/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/+ directory.

NOTE: In this example all data will be lost when you remove the `mariadb`
container. You may want to look at various options for
link:https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/[managing data in
containers].

=== Service file explained

Let's now go through the +docker-mariadb.service+ file:

The +[Unit]+ section contains information about the service itself. Here you
can find the `Description` which will be visible almost everywhere (try
`systemctl list-units`).

The `Requires` parameter specifies which service should be *activated and marked
to be started before our service*. In our case (if we want to start/enable
the `docker-mariadb.service`) the `docker.service` service will be
started/enabled too.

The `After` parameter configures the ordering of services. In our case the
`docker-mariadb.service` will wait for the `docker.service` to start and only
then will it be started. If we don't provide the `After` parameter, our service
would be started in parallel with the `docker.service`. This could trigger some
issues because there is some chance that the Docker service would be not fully
started, when we try to run the container.

The `[Service]` section defines the actual service.

The `User` parameter specifies the user that will be used to execute the
command.  This is optional but it's a good idea to *keep user privileges as
minimal as possible*.

The `Restart` parameter specifies when the service should be restarted. The
`on-failure` value means that the service will be restarted when the service is
terminated in an unclean way. The `RestartSec` parameter specifies how long we
should wait before we try to restart the service.

The `Environment` parameter is useful to set environment variables for
the processes that will be started. I use it to lower the memory
requirements of the JVM for WildFly (see below).

The `ExecStartPre` parameters specify which command should be run before we
start the main process. I use it to clean up (stop and remove) containers.
Please note the minus sign just before the command. This tells systemd to not
fail the boot even if the command fails.

The `ExecStart` parameter is the heart of the service. Here we define *what
should be started to run our service*.

The `ExecStop` parameter is similar to `ExecStart`, but will run if
we want to stop the service.

The `[Install]` section defines the configuration used at service install time.

The `WantedBy` parameter specifies that our service should be started when the
`multi-user` target is reached. Since this particular target is the default,
we enable our service by default.

NOTE: If you want to learn more about systemd a good place to start is the
link:http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html[systemd.service]
and
link:http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html[systemd.unit]
man pages. The link:http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/[systemd
homepage] has a lot of resources too, including nice blog posts for
administrators.


== The `docker-wildfly` service

Now we create a similar `docker-wildfly.service` file for the WildFly application
server:

----
[Unit]
Description=WildFly node
Requires=docker-mariadb.service
After=docker-mariadb.service

[Service]
User=goldmann
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10
Environment="JAVA_OPTS=-Xms64m -Xmx512m"
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker kill wildfly-mariadb
ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/docker rm wildfly-mariadb
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run --name wildfly --link mariadb:mariadb -p 8080:8080 wildfly-mariadb
ExecStop=-/usr/bin/docker stop wildfly-mariadb

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

Again, place it in the +/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/+ directory.

This file is similar to the first, but with one *very important difference*:
the `After` and `Requires` parameters specify the `docker-mariadb` service.
This is because we want to boot WildFly after the MariaDB database.

If you want to run WildFly on multiple nodes, just copy the file and edit appropriate
values (node name).

NOTE: Although it is possible to run multiple containers from one systemd
service file (hint: `Type=oneshot` and `RemainAfterExit=true`) I recommend you
have one service per container. This way you'll have better control over them.

=== The `wildfly-mariadb` image

In the service above we used the `wildfly-mariadb` Docker image. The Dockerfile and
instructions on how to build it are
link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-mariadb[available on GitHub].

== Enable and run the service

To be able to enable or start the service, systemd needs to be reloaded to
pick up our new service files. Run:

    $ systemctl daemon-reload

This command will also mark our service to be started on boot (remember
the `WantedBy` parameters?). Now we can start our application:

    $ systemctl start docker-wildfly

To confirm that everything worked, run:

    $ systemctl status docker-wildfly
    $ docker ps

Now you can point your browser to http://localhost:8080/wildfly-kitchensink/
and everything should work.

NOTE: if you use systemd to start the containers on boot, it's a good idea to
disable the buit-in Docker functionaly by copying the
+/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service+ to
+/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/docker.service+ and adding the
following switch: +--restart=false+ to the Docker daemon in the `ExecStart`
line. Do not forget to reload the systemd daemon afterwards.

== Disable and remove the service

When using custom scripts (like we do) we cannot use the `systemctl disable`
commands (this is by systemd design -- if you want know more please read
link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=955379#c14[this comment]). In
our case we need to remove (or rename) the `docker-*.service` files and then
run:

    $ systemctl reset-failed

== Summary

This was just a small introduction to the Docker and systemd world. I hope you
can leverage it to run your services since it's a pretty good choice. I should
mention here the link:http://openshift.github.io/geard/[geard project] which
aims to do what I described above (and much, much more).
