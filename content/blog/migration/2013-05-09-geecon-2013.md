I haven't been giving talks lately. There were various reasons for it; but the most
important is that I was busy with the <a
href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/JBossAS7">Fedora/JBoss AS stuff</a> for
quite some time. The good (?) news is that I'm back to *real* programming.
Since a couple of months I'm helping with <a
href="http://torquebox.org/">TorqueBox</a>, expecially in the messaging space.
This is a great opportunity to share this cool stuff with people.

I've decided to submit my first ever talk to <a
href="http://2013.geecon.org/">GeeCON</a> and it was accepted, yay! I know the
conference pretty well and I enjoy it every time I'm attending. This is also
true to the <a href="http://2013.geecon.org/openspaces">OpenSpaces</a> co-event
which is held the day after the main conference (this year it's 18th May). For
more information about the conference please reach out to the <a
href="http://2013.geecon.org/">conference page</a>.

I'm giving a talk titled *Messaging and scheduled jobs made simple* about
messaging features of TorqueBox on the **first day (Wed, May 15), at 11:40am**.

What can you expect?

* Really quick introduction to TorqueBox (nope, I'm not going to discuss all its features)
* <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bncdq.html">Java Message Service</a> concepts refresh
* Messaging features explained **with a demo for each feature showing how to use it**
* Introduction to scheduled jobs (with demo too!)

Hope to see you at GeeCON!
