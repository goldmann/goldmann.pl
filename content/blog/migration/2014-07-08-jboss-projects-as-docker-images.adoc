link:https://twitter.com/marekgoldmann/status/474867431736082432[I recently
announced the availability] of the official link:http://wildfly.org/[WildFly]
Docker image. Since then, link:https://hub.docker.com/u/jboss/[our
portfolio of images has grown a bit] - as of today, we have 8 images. But this
is not the end. We want to have *a nice collection* of JBoss projects shipped as
Docker images.

== Automated builds

All of our images are hooked up to
link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/[automated builds]. When we push
an update to link:https://github.com/jboss/dockerfiles[the repository], a new
image will be created and pushed to the global registry. I also set up links
between the images so if a base image is updated, our dependent images will be
rebuilt. This is a fully *automated* process that ensures you get the latest
available software.

== Docker microsite

Today I'm happy to announce the link:http://www.jboss.org/docker/[Docker dedicated microsite on jboss.org].

We crafted the http://jboss.org/docker website to show, in one place,
all the images we currently ship. It additionally provides basic
information about each project and detailed information about each
image.

Of course, the list of all repositories is also available from link:https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/jboss/[hub.docker.com]!

== Help us to help you!

We're happy to add new images! You can even help us by
link:https://github.com/jboss/dockerfiles/pulls[opening a pull request] or just
link:https://github.com/jboss/dockerfiles/issues[let us know] what projects you
would like to see in the portfolio. Do not hesitate to create bug reports (if
you find any) too!
