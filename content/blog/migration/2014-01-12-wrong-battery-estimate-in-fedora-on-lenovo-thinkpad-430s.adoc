I had a power mangement issue when running *Fedora 19* (and later 20) on my
link:http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/t430[Lenovo
ThinkPad 430s]. When the battery was low - the laptop just powered off itself,
without a clean shutdown or even warning me. As you may guess - this wasn't
something I very happy about.

== Cause

I discovered that it happens when the battery is *still at 15%*. The system
reported at that time still about *40 min* of available time.

By default Fedora uses the *time based policy for battery power management*. In
almost all cases this is a good choice, but this time it won't fly.

== Solution

Instead of fixing the issue properly (finding the source of wrong estimate or
wrong battery reading) I found a workaround which works very well and does not
involve any magic: I disabled the time based and *switched to percentage based
policy*.

----
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power use-time-for-policy false
----

The other thing we need to do is to adjust when the warning will apear and what
type of action should be executed when the battery level is critical.

----
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-critical 25
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-low 30

gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power percentage-action 20
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power critical-battery-action 'suspend'
----

The system will warn me when the battery level is at 30%, another warning will
apear at 25% and the action will be executed at 20% of battery level. What
action? I *choose supend* because in almost all cases I have apower plug
somewhere nearby, so I just need to plug in and I can work again almost
immediately.

You can check the values for all power management settings by using this command:

----
gsettings list-recursively org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power
----

If you prefer graphical tools -- you can use `dconf-editor` to edit these
values. The gui additionally shows a description for each key and what values
are available to set.

=== Update 30.07.2014

The real reason for this issue was a bad firmware in the battery. Lenovo
released a

upgrade utility], but... only for Windows. For Linux users the only way is to
replace the battery or ask a friend with Windows to do the upgrade for you. I
choose the 2nd option :) On the
