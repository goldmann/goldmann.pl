Inspired by
link:http://spinningmatt.wordpress.com/2014/01/08/a-recipe-for-starting-cloud-images-with-virt-install/[Matt's
blog post] I've decided to make something that is similar but better fits
my use case. I plan to do some clustering and routing testing and therefore I
need to have similar VMs running side-by-side. These images will be short-lived
and I would like to automate as many things I can.

Additionally, I found out that the images shipped by Fedora require some changes
to work well in my case, for example the default 2GB disk is too small.

== Script

You can see link:https://gist.github.com/goldmann/8455702[my script here].

My script does create a new domain with the desired name with the cloud disk
image. I use the a QCOW2 image to not eat all the free space on my SSD. The disk
can be optionally grown to the desired size. The whole install is done without VNC
using the text method. The domain is optionally run after the setup
completes.

I use the cloud-init script *only* for the initial setup (setting the password)
- afterwards it is removed from the image. The same thing happens to the
ISO used for the cloud-init configuration - it's ejected and removed from
the disk afterwards.

== Sample run

After about a minute I have a registered domain with a Fedora 20 disk image
on a 20GB QCOW2 disk. Pretty good. And I can run the command as many times I want
to deploy new VMs.

Along with the disk image -- the script creates a log file (in my case
`host1/host1.log`) in which you can see the messages from the commands that were run
during the installation.
