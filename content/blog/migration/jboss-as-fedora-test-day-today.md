We're going today to test the (very) fresh JBoss Application Server which was [packaged into Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/JBossAS7). I hope you have some time to join us!

### Where I can read more about the test day? ###

Most recent information you can find on the [JBoss AS Fedora Test Day wiki page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2012-04-17_JBoss_Application_Server).

### How should I prepare? ###

Make sure you have a Fedora 17 environment somewhere (VM preferred) with latest updates installed. This is **very** important.

### What we'll test? ###

We'll have some [test cases](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2012-04-17_JBoss_Application_Server#Test_Cases). But you're not limited to these test cases. Feel free to test the server at your own too!

### Where we'll meet? ###

I am available on IRC in #fedora-test-day channel on freenode.

### How can I participate? ###

You can help us with testing and proposing test cases! After you execute the test cases, please add your results to the [table](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2012-04-17_JBoss_Application_Server#Test_Results).

See you online!
