WARNING: This guide is based on an old version of Docker. The instructions you
find below may be already removed or changed in the Docker codebase.

In my
link:/blog/2014/01/21/connecting-docker-containers-on-multiple-hosts/[last blog
post] I explained how to run a Docker installation across multiple hosts.
In the comments I was asked if it would be possible to use a DHCP server to
assign IPs to the containers. I thought immediately -- why not? In fact,
assigning IPs using DHCP is a nice way to overcome the
link:/blog/2014/01/21/connecting-docker-containers-on-multiple-hosts/#_the_issue_ip_assignment[IP
assignment issue I talked about before].

== Set up

The set up is pretty similar to my
link:/blog/2014/01/21/connecting-docker-containers-on-multiple-hosts/#_set_up[earlier
work].

The difference is that I want to run a DHCP server *on each* of the hosts.
It will be responsible for assigning the IPs to all of the containers connected to the
`docker0` bridge on that host.

You may ask why I want to run so many DHCP servers? Of course one server would
do the job of assigning the IP's (in fact, this was my initial set-up). Then I
  realized that it would be easier to manage routing of the container's traffic
  if we have a DHCP server on every host.

Since we want to have the containers run on the same network, there
will be many DHCP servers working on *that network*. The trick is to reserve a
bunch of IP's for each host so as not to interfere with other hosts (in my case it's
10 addresses per host) and drop the DHCP requests on each `br0` Open vSwitch
bridge.

=== New scripts

Additionally I rewrote link:https://gist.github.com/goldmann/8455702[my earlier script]
that prepares the virtual machines for me. I decided to
drop the use of link:http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/[cloud-init]
entirely in favor of link:http://libguestfs.org/[libguestfs] -- a great Swiss
Army knife written by link:http://rwmj.wordpress.com/[Rich]. If you're not
familiar with it -- it's a tool for offline manipulation of disk images. And it
does the job damn well.

You can install libguestfs tools on your system by running this
command:

----
yum -y install libguestfs-tools
----

Install `liguestfs-tools` before you use my scripts.

NOTE: The first run of link:http://libguestfs.org/guestfish.1.html[`guestfish`]
can take a bit, since it creates the
link:http://libguestfs.org/febootstrap.8.html#supermin_appliances[supermin
appliance]. Also, if you run it in a virtualized environment it will
perform a bit worse compared to bare metal.

The new scripts are avilable in the
link:https://github.com/goldmann/docker-dhcp[docker-dhcp repository on
GitHub].

The logic of preparing and registering the image as a libvirt domain was split
into two scripts:

* link:https://github.com/goldmann/docker-dhcp/blob/master/prepare-image.sh[`prepare-image.sh`] -- update the system, modify the image,
* link:https://github.com/goldmann/docker-dhcp/blob/master/register-domain.sh[`register-domain.sh`] -- copy the image to a custom location and register a
  domain under the new name.

The split made it possible to create the image once and create as many domains
as you want in seconds.

I placed a lot of comments in these scripts, so I hope everything is
self-explaining. Let me know if that's not the case!

==== Base image

To create a VM with everything preinstalled to make the setup
easier the only thing you need to do is to download the QCOW2 image from
link:cloud.fedoraproject.org[cloud.fedoraproject.org] and run the script
providing the cloud image as the parameter, like this:

----
$ ./prepare-image.sh Fedora-x86_64-20-20131211.1-sda.qcow2
Wed, 29 Jan 2014 12:20:57 +0100 Cleaniung up...
Wed, 29 Jan 2014 12:20:58 +0100 Modifying the image...
Wed, 29 Jan 2014 12:25:15 +0100 Resizing the disk...
Wed, 29 Jan 2014 12:26:06 +0100 Image 'image.qcow2' created!
----

NOTE: Executing the above script can take some time. It took about 5 minutes for me
to prepare the image. Please keep in mind that it does the full system update
and it installs some additional software as well.

This script injects the `network.sh` script which will be used later to
configure the network inside the hosts.

==== Host domains

Now we have the base image prepared: `image.qcow2`. Time to make use of it and
register two domains based on it. For this purpose I use the
`register-domain.sh` script:

[source,shell]
----
$ ./register-domain.sh image.qcow2 host1
Wed, 29 Jan 2014 13:52:51 +0100 Installing the domain and adjusting the configuration...
Wed, 29 Jan 2014 13:52:51 +0100 Domain host1 registered!
Wed, 29 Jan 2014 13:52:51 +0100 Launching the host1 domain...
Wed, 29 Jan 2014 13:52:52 +0100 Domain started, waiting for the IP...
Wed, 29 Jan 2014 13:53:30 +0100 You can ssh to the 192.168.122.144 host using 'fedora' username and 'fedora' password or use the 'virsh console host1' command to directly attach to the console
----

You can log-in using the `fedora` / `fedora` credentials.

NOTE: If you don't want to run the domain immediately after creation -- use the
`RUN_AFTER` environment variable and set it to `false`.

Run the `register-domain.sh` script twice with `host1` and `host2` as the arguments.

=== DHCP configuration explained

The DHCP server will be run on every host and listen only for requests on the `docker0`
interface since it's configured to look for the `172.16.42.0/24` network only.
The first 9 IP addresses from this network are reserved (can be assigned
manually to additional hosts), the rest will be available to the DHCP clients.

Every DHCP server will only be responsible for a part of the network. For
example, the server on `host1` will assign addresses from `172.16.42.10` to
`172.16.42.19`, whereas `host2` will will assign addresses from `172.16.42.20`
to `172.16.42.29`.

NOTE: This is just an example -- you can expand the default values to run more
than 10 containers on one host.

The `host1` `docker0` network interface will have the `172.16.42.1` address
assigned, `host2` will have `172.16.42.2`, and so on.

== Make it work!

I assume that we have already started `host1` and `host2` as explained above.

=== Networking

Now it's time to prepare the networking on both hosts. Log-in to both hosts and
get the IP addresses of the `eth0` network interfaces. Now run the `network.sh`
script (it's located in the `/home/fedora` directory) on both hosts.

NOTE: I assume that `host1` has `192.168.122.31` IP and `host2` has `192.168.122.2`.

On `host1` run the script with the IP of `host2`:

----
$ sudo ./network.sh 1 192.168.122.2
----

And do the opposite on `host2`:

----
$ sudo ./network.sh 2 192.168.122.31
----

NOTE: When you run the `network.sh` script for the first time, you may see
messages similar to `bridge docker0 doesn't exist` -- don't worry, this is
normal.

The GRE tunnel should now be established and a DHCP server should be running on
`host1`. You can confirm this by pinging the `docker0` bridge addresses on each host.

=== Containers

There is one requirement for the container image -- it needs to have a DHCP
client installed. Sadly the default `fedora` image does not have the `dhclient`
package installed. To make things easy I prepared the
link:https://index.docker.io/u/goldmann/fedora-dhcp/[`goldmann/fedora-dhcp`]
image. The only difference between `fedora` image is the addition of
`dhclient`.

Download this image on both hosts:

----
docker pull goldmann/fedora-dhcp
----

If you run the `goldmann/fedora-dhcp` image you'll see that there is no network
interfaces beside the loopback. This is because Docker is run with the
`-b=none` flag and it does not know about any network interfaces to bind to, so
it does not create the ethernet adapter in the container.

But we still want to have networking. The only option at the moment is to use
the `-lxc-conf` flag when running the image, like this:

----
docker run -i -t \
-lxc-conf="lxc.network.type = veth" \
-lxc-conf="lxc.network.link = docker0" \
-lxc-conf="lxc.network.flags = up" \
goldmann/fedora-dhcp /bin/bash
----

This will start a new container with a virtual ethernet adapter which is
attached to the `docker0` bridge. Sweet!

=== Obtaining the IP address

Since the Docker container does not run anything besides the command you
specify (in our case `/bin/bash`) -- it does not run the scripts that
configures the network too. We need to do it by hand.

NOTE: I hope this will change in the near future. One option is to make systemd
run well in the Docker containers.

After you get the prompt from the container, you can simply run the
`dhclient` command. This will obtain the address from the DHCP server, exit and
leave a shell just for you.

----
bash-4.2# ip a s dev eth0
17: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000

    inet6 fe80::1cd4:13ff:fec7:9dfd/64 scope link

bash-4.2# ping -c 1 google.com

rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 55.672/55.672/55.672/0.000 ms
----

NOTE: You can also use the `/etc/init.d/network restart` command to obtain the IP.

You can (should!) try it on `host1` and `host2`. You should get the same
result with no IP conflict and be able to access the Internet as well as other
containers on the network.

Enjoy!

== Things to improve

There are of course some things that could be improved to make this setup
easier.

1. Make link:http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/[systemd] available
   in the container -- this would boot the networking and get the IP address
   automatically for us.

2. Stop Docker from (blindly) assigning IP addresses when we specify the
`-b=BRIDGE` flag. Docker currently  assumes that it manages the container
network and nothing else is allowed to do so. I hope this will change in the
future.
