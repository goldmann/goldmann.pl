== What and why

I am always sad seeing all the potential damage done to your local system, just
to set up your development environment. Every time you do almost the same thing,
every time you mess your system up in almost the same way. It really doesn't matter
in which language you're wrtiting and what frameworks you use but *Java* (and Maven)
is a pretty good, uhm, example.

A development environment is not only about IDE and JDK, in almost all cases we
need to have an application server too. We set it up; our application works
great on it, but when we deploy it to production we experience deployment
issues. Some things changed: we have different JDK, different network
interfaces and so on. *Everything* can affect your application.

Imagine now an environment which is exactly the same as your production.

*Welcome to Docker!*

Docker makes it easy to create snapshots of your container. This means that you
can deploy your app, create a snapshot, push the image to a repository for
deployment and launch it in production from there.

I want to make this a series of blog posts about how we can leverage Docker in
the Java (but not only) world to make the development more pleasant and
expectable with every iteration _polishing_ the setup.

== TL;DR;

In this blog post *I'll focus on the application server deployment*. It shows
how to set-up an environment for developing Java applications for
http://wildfly.org/[WildFly].  It uses
https://www.jboss.org/products/jbds.html[JBoss Developer Studio] as the IDE and
the application is deployed to the server runnning in a
https://www.docker.io/[Docker] container. Curious? Read on!

Please note that everything below is pretty rough, since it's my first take on
it. Any hints on making it more developer friendly are appreciated, just leave a
note in the comments.

== Preparations

First of all we need to get all the required stuff:

1. *JDK*: You should have something on your system, if not: `yum install
   java-devel` should help. Or go to
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle]...
2. *Docker*: You can use the `docker-io` package available
   http://goldmann.fedorapeople.org/repos/docker.repo[in my repo] if you're
   running Fedora. Otherwise you can follow the http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/[installation instructions]
   available on the Docker website.
3. *JBoss Developer Studio*: It can be downloaded from the
   https://www.jboss.org/products/jbds.html[product page].
4. *WildFly*: It's required by the IDE to detect what server we're using and
   to get all required libraries locally. We can download it
   http://wildfly.org/downloads/[from here]. Please grab
   the `8.0.0.Beta1` version.

Next steps assume you have everything installed and working.

=== Docker image

I created a Docker image with WildFly on it. The application server is
configured to be ready to run, so we can manage it from the IDE and deploy our
applications to it.

The image is avalable in the Docker
https://index.docker.io/u/goldmann/[`goldmann/jbds-wildfly`] repository.

Please pull it. This will grab the latest version for you:

----
$ docker pull goldmann/jbds-wildfly
----

You can now try to run it to confirm that it works as expected:

----
$ docker run -i -t goldmann/jbds-wildfly:wildfly
The container is running. You can use your IDE now to deploy your apps.
----

Great, it works. Now we can proceed to the IDE setup.

NOTE: You can run the container in detached mode by using the `-d` switch. See
the http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/commandline/cli/#run[documentation of the run command] for more info.

=== JBoss Developer Studio

Lets open JBDS and teach this thing to talk to the application server.

==== Adding a new remote connection

NOTE: You can skip this by
link:/files/posts/docker-remote-connection-jbds[importing the connection].
Right click in the _Remote Systems_ tab, select _Import..._.


In the _Remote Systems_ tab we need to create a new connection to the Docker
container. Please select _Linux_ from the list.

In the next step *please leave* the _Host Name_ field with +LOCALHOST+ entered.
Last, specify the _Connection Name_, I choose +Docker+.

NOTE: The prepared Docker image exports the following container ports: +22+,
+8080+ and +9990+ as *local ports*: +10022+, +18080+ and +19990+.

In the _Files_ step, select the _ssh.files_ configuration.
In the _Processes_ step, select the _processes.shell.linux_ configuration.
In the _Shells_ step, select the _ssh.shells_ configuration.
In the _Ssh Terminals_ step, select the _ssh.terminals_ configuration.

After you create the connection, please right click on the _Ssh Terminals_ and
select _Subsystems_. On that page we need to change the port from +22+ to
+10022+.

++++

Now we can try to connect to the container, right click on the connection and
select _Connect_. You'll be asked about password and user ID, please use +root+ / +verysecure+.

NOTE: If you select the _Save password_ option you can be asked for
creating/using the Secure Storage Password.

A nice feature is the Ssh Terminal -- you can launch one and execute commands
directly *inside the container*. Try it!

===== Troubleshooting

If you hit any issues, please try following:

1. Please make sure your Docker container is running.
2. Check firewall. Docker container (at least on Fedora) are connected the +docker0+ interface.
3. If this doesn't help -- let me know in the comments, I'll try to help.

==== Adding a new server

Please unpack the WildFly zip you downloaded.

In the _Servers_ tab please add new new server. From the list of available
server choose _JBoss Community > WildFly 8.0 (Experimental)_, click _Next_.

*Please change* the _Server's host name_ field from +localhost+ to +0.0.0.0+.
Because of the nature of the containers this will let us manage
the server from IDE directly.

++++
<a rel="browser" class="picture" href="/images/wildfly-jbds-docker/ide_new_server.png" title="Create new server wizard"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Create new server wizard" src="/images/wildfly-jbds-docker/ide_new_server.png" /></a>
++++

In the next step in the _Home Directory_ field specify the directory to where
you unpacked the WildFly zip content.

In the next step please check the _Listen on all interfaces..._ and _Expose your
management_ checkboxes. We need to change the deployment from local to remote,
please select _Remote System Deployment_ from the dropdown.

After finishing the host set up wizard select the newly created _Docker_ host
from dropdown.

We're ready to set the _Remote Server Home_ field. Click _Browse_ and expand _Root
> / > usr / > share > wildfly_.

++++
<a rel="browser" class="picture" href="/images/wildfly-jbds-docker/ide_home_directory.png" title="Browsing for the remote home directory of the application server"><img class="img-responsive" alt="Browsing for the remote home directory of the application server" src="/images/wildfly-jbds-docker/ide_home_directory.png" /></a>
++++

The last thing is to change the server settings, double click on the newly created server.

In the _Server Ports_ section please change the web port to +18080+ and
management port to +19990+.

In the _Management Login Credentials_ section fields please enter +admin+ and +Admin#70365+ as credentials.

You can now try to start your server. See the Console tab for the output.

OK, we have now a new server defined, which is running inside a container. Let's
prepare an application to make use of it!

=== Application

JBoss' developers provide a great set of examples for various technologies under the
http://www.jboss.org/jdf/[JBoss Developer Framework]. There are many
http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/get-started/articles/[articles],
http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/get-started/videos/[videos] and -- most
exciting --
https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts[code].

We'll use one example by creating a new project, select _File > New >
Example... > Project Examples_. Feel free to select example what you want. I
used the _Web Applications > kitchensink_ one.

JBDS will download all the required code and preapre it to run.

The last step is to add the application to the server. It'll be automatically
deployed and ready to check at http://localhost:18080/jboss-as-kitchensink.

++++

=== Done

Please note the that you can stop the container, launch another one and
still be able to develop your app!

If you get hit by a long deployment time, then most probably you see the
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBIDE-12202[JBIDE-12202] which will be fixed in
the next version of JBDS.
