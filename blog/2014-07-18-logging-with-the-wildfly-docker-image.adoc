There are various ways to set up logging for Docker containers. Docker itself
has a built-in `logs` *command*, you can *mount a volume* from the host and save
the logs there, you can create a *different container* that would be
only responsible for log handling, or set up a *logging daemon*. Every method
has some pros and cons and it is up to you to choose the one that fits best.

Let's go through each of these options, learn a litle about the it,
and modify the `jboss/wildfly` image use it.

NOTE: I won't talk about WildFly logging in general, in this blog post I'll focus
on the required changes (if any) to make it work inside a container. If you're
interested in the logging subsystem configuration, please
link:https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY8/Logging+Configuration[refer to
the documentation].

== TL;DR;

Don't use `docker logs` in production. Mounting volumes from a host is simple
but could be tricky, especially if you run
link:http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/docker-and-selinux/[SELinux]. If you set
it up correctly, you'll be happy. Using data containers is fun and probably a
good way to do logging. If you need more control, set up a logging daemon.

Examples are link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-logging[available on GitHub].

== `docker logs`

The link:https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#logs[`logs`
command] is a handy feature of Docker. If the process you run inside of the
container prints something to standard output (or standard error) - the
message is saved in a log and available for reading later.

Using `docker logs` is the simplest way to read logs from a container.

----
# Start the container and save the container ID
ID=$(docker run -d jboss/wildfly)

# Use the ID to read the logs from the selected container
docker logs -f $ID
----

This approach is nice if you want to see what's going on inside of the
container. I *do not recommend* using it in production as the only way of
logging. You may ask why? Every line of the output is saved in a JSON formatted
file (see `/var/lib/docker/containers/$ID/$ID-json.log`) accompanied by a bit
of metadata (timestamp for example, where most logs include it anyway). The
log file can grow pretty quickly, especially if you have a lot of messages.
Grepping JSON is not much fun either. Additionally stacktraces are split line-by-line.

If this is not an issue for you - go for it.

NOTE: You can access logs from a stopped container too, which is a plus.

In the `jboss/wildfly` image, we didn't change the default logging configuration.
Everything that goes to the console will be available using the `docker logs`
command.

You can change this behavior by customizing the
`/opt/wildfly/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file (if you actually
use the default `standalone` profile). For example you can remove the `CONSOLE`
handler entirely to stop printing anything to the console.

== Mounting a volume from the host

link:https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume[Mounting
a volume from the host] and exposing it in the container is another way to store
logs. In this case every file written to the directory will be immediately
available on the host. This way you can have multiple containers saving logs to
the host's directory (which may be *very handy* in some cases).

NOTE: The biggest issue with this approach is that *it is not
portable*.  You need to setup the directories once again when you move
to another host.

=== Permission denied

If you use the `-v` switch from the `docker run` command and try to mount a
*non-existent directory from the host* -- a new directory will be created on the
host with `root` as the owner and `755` permissions making it not writable for
any other user than `root` *inside* of the container. The `jboss/wildfly` image
does use the `wildfly` user to run the Java process, so it will not be able to
store logs in the mounted directory.

Of course there is a way to make it work.

=== Let's make it writable

The trick is to have a user *with the same uid/gid both in the container and on the host*.

The `jboss/wildfly` image uses a `wildfly` user with
link:https://github.com/jboss/dockerfiles/blob/master/wildfly/Dockerfile[a well
known user uid/gid] (`431/433`) to run the server. We can use this information
and *create a `wildfly-logs` user on the host* with the same uid/gid. This will
make the mounted volume available to read/write operations for the `wildfly`
user inside of the container.

Run on the host:

----
groupadd -r wildfly-logs -g 433
useradd -u 431 -r -g wildfly-logs -s /sbin/nologin -c "WildFly container logs" wildfly-logs
----

Cool, now we have the user, let's create the directory we will mount later in the container.

----
mkdir /opt/logs/wildfly-01
chown wildfly-logs:wildfly-logs /opt/logs/wildfly-01
chcon -t svirt_sandbox_file_t /opt/logs/wildfly-01
----

Please note the last command. We need to change the *SELinux label* to
`svirt_sandbox_file_t` for this directory so the Docker daemon can write to it.
You can read more about
link:http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/docker-and-selinux/[SELinux and Docker on
the Project Atomic website].

Now we can start the container with the volume mounted in
`/opt/wildfly/standalone/log`.

----
docker run -d -v /opt/logs/wildfly-01:/opt/wildfly/standalone/log jboss/wildfly
----

NOTE: The same `wildfly-logs` user can be used for any `jboss/wildfly`
containers, because each container has a `wildfly` user created with the
particular uid/gid.

Read more about using Docker volumes in the
link:https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/[documentation].

After you boot the container, you can go to the `/opt/logs/wildfly-01` directory on
the host. You should find the `server.log` file there.

== Using a data container

This is a variation of the logging to a mounted host directory approach. In
this case instead of mounting a directory from host we use another container's
exposed volume. Such containers are called *data containers*. Their
responsibility is to hold some data. You can use one container to save logs
from many other containers. As a plus, this approach is portable -- you can
take your containers and launch them on a different host and everything will work.

=== The data container image

NOTE: All files are link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-logging/tree/master/data-container/data[available on GitHub].

First we need to prepare an image that will be used to launch a container where we
want to store our logs.

----
FROM jboss/wildfly
RUN mkdir -p /opt/wildfly/logs
VOLUME /opt/wildfly/logs
CMD true
----

Save the above snippet as `Dockerfile` and build it with `docker build
--rm --tag=data .`.

NOTE: The `CMD` instruction above is not a mistake. To use the exposed
volumes from a container it doesn't need to be actually running. After
executing the `true` command the container will be stopped, but we'll
still have access to the volumes.

You may wonder why we extend the `jboss/wildfly` image in first place and not
use a clean `fedora` image. The reason is that the `jboss/wildfly` image already has
a `wildfly` user created. As link:#_let_s_make_it_writeable[I mentioned
above], the same user will be used to launch the Java processes and if we mount a
volume owned by this user, it will be available for writing. We don't waste
any disk space by using this approach, because Docker uses a copy-on-write
filesystem.

Let's run our data container:

----
docker run --name data data
----

=== Exported volumes and paths

Mounted data volumes are visible under *the same* path as they were exported.
This means that if we export the `/opt/wildfly/logs` volume in the data
container and mount it in our WildFly container -- it'll be visible under the
`/opt/wildfly/logs` path there too.

NOTE: This is not strictly true if you try to export a path that is actually a
symlink. In such cases the resolved path will be exported, not the symlink, so
in our case it will be `/opt/wildfly-8.1.0.Final/logs` instead of
`/opt/wildfly/logs`, but this won't change anything for us.

Sometimes having a single location mounted in many containers under same path
is desirable (for example database data), but in our case (logging from
multiple WildFly containers) it would cause problems. Imagine an exported
`/opt/wildfly/standalone/log` volume being mounted in many WildFly containers at the
same time...

There are many solutions; for example you can change the WildFly configuration
to log to different directories or you can just symlink the
`/opt/wildfly/standalone/log` directory to some `/opt/wildfly/logs`
subdirectory in the way it makes sense for you.

In this blog post I'll show how to use the first solution.

=== Modifying the WildFly image

NOTE: All files are link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-logging/tree/master/data-container/wildfly[available on GitHub].

Now we create a new image that extends the `jboss/wildfly` image. The change we
want to make is to modify the configuration that controls where the logs are stored:

----
FROM jboss/wildfly
RUN sed -i 's|<file relative-to="jboss.server.log.dir" path="server.log"/>|\<file relative-to="jboss.home.dir" path="logs/\${jboss.host.name}/server.log"/\>|' /opt/wildfly/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
----

This simple `sed` call changes the default location of the log file. We make the path
host aware by using the `jboss.host.name` property. At the time of launching
the container we have full control over the hostname. We can us the `-h` switch
from the `docker run` command to specify the host name or just leave it as-is
and `jboss.host.name` will be resolved to the shortened container id.

Let's build the image:

----
docker build --rm --tag wildfly-logs .
----

And finally launch it:

----
docker run -d -h wildfly-01 --name wildfly-01 --volumes-from data wildfly-logs
----

We can launch even more containers and all of them will save logs in our `data`
container:

----
docker run -d -h wildfly-02 --name wildfly-02 --volumes-from data wildfly-logs
docker run -d -h wildfly-03 --name wildfly-03 --volumes-from data wildfly-logs
----

=== Getting access to the logs

We log from all our containers to one place, cool, but how to get access to those logs? It's not so hard:

----
docker run -it --rm --volumes-from data -v `pwd`:/backup fedora sh -c 'cp -r /opt/wildfly-8.1.0.Final/logs /backup && chown -R 1000:1000 /backup/'
----

This (somewhat lengthy) command will start a new container with the current
directory mounted as `/backup` and the exported volume from the `data`
container mounted in its path. Then it copies all the logs from the exported
volume to our local directory and changes ovnership of these files to my local
user. This way we can have full control over these files. My local account has
a uid/gid of `1000`, so this works for me. You'll probably need to adjust the
uid/gid to match your own.

NOTE: Do not forget to `chcon -t svirt_sandbox_file_t .` the directory where
you want to store the logs locally so the the copy can be performed.

----
$ ls -hall logs/*
logs/wildfly-02:
total 16K
drwxr-xr-x. 2 goldmann goldmann 4,0K 07-16 16:12 .
drwxr-xr-x. 4 goldmann goldmann 4,0K 07-16 16:12 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 goldmann goldmann 4,9K 07-16 16:12 server.log

logs/wildfly-03:
total 12K
drwxr-xr-x. 2 goldmann goldmann 4,0K 07-16 16:12 .
drwxr-xr-x. 4 goldmann goldmann 4,0K 07-16 16:12 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 goldmann goldmann 3,9K 07-16 16:12 server.log
----

Exactly what we needed!

== Logging daemon

Logging to a file is nice, but sometimes you need to manage logging in a more
powerful way. The are many solutions available like
link:http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng[syslog-ng],
link:http://www.rsyslog.com/[rsyslog], or link:http://logstash.net/[logstash]. No
matter which one you choose, they're all pretty flexible and easy to set up.

I would like to show you how to set up a `syslog-ng` daemon (running in a
container) with the `jboss/wildfly` Docker image.

=== syslog-ng image

NOTE: All files are link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-logging/tree/master/syslog/syslog[available on GitHub].

The first step is to prepare the `syslog-ng` Docker image.

----
FROM fedora
RUN yum -y install syslog-ng && yum clean all
ADD syslog-ng.conf /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf

VOLUME /var/log/wildfly
EXPOSE 514/udp

CMD ["/usr/sbin/syslog-ng", "-F", "--no-caps"]
----

And here is the simple `syslog-ng.conf`:

----
@version:3.4

options {
    flush_lines (0);
    time_reopen (10);
    log_fifo_size (1000);
    chain_hostnames (off);
    use_dns (no);
    use_fqdn (no);
    create_dirs (no);
    keep_hostname (yes);
};

source s_sys {
    udp(ip(0.0.0.0) port(514));
};

destination d_wildfly { file("/var/log/wildfly/$HOST.log" template("$ISODATE $PRIORITY $MSG\n") template_escape(no)); };

log { source(s_sys); destination(d_wildfly); };
----

This is a very simple `syslog-ng` configuration file. When a new message arrives,
it will be saved to a file corresponding to the hostname the message comes from.
And since we can easily change the hostname of our containers, we will
immediatelly know which container logged what.

Build the image with `docker build --rm --tag syslog .`.

NOTE: I need to mention that the true power in this (or any other) logger
solution is to be able to filter and route the selected messages. The above example
is just a start, don't be afraid to extend it!

We can start the logging container and proceed to the next step.

----
docker run -d --name syslog syslog
----

=== Modifying the WildFly image

NOTE: All files are link:https://github.com/goldmann/wildfly-docker-logging/tree/master/syslog/wildfly[available on GitHub].

Since logging to syslog is not enabled by default we need to modify our WildFly
configuration to let the server know where the `syslog-ng` daemon is listening.

To do this we need to add the `syslog-handler` to the logging subsystem in the `/opt/wildfly/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file:

----
<syslog-handler name="SYSLOG">
    <level name="INFO"/>
    <hostname value="${jboss.host.name}" />
    <server-address value="${env.SYSLOG_PORT_514_UDP_ADDR}" />
    <port value="514" />
    <formatter><syslog-format syslog-type="RFC3164"/></formatter>
</syslog-handler>
----

And enable it:

----
<handlers>
    <handler name="SYSLOG"/>
</handlers>
----

The above configuration will make sure we send the messages to the proper destination.
We use the `SYSLOG_PORT_514_UDP_ADDR` environment variable to determine the IP
address of the host where `syslog-ng` is running. More on this variable in a bit.

Now you need to build the image:

----
docker build --rm --tag wildfly-syslog .
----

That's all. Now you need to run one or more `wildfly-syslog` containers. All of
them will be saving logs to the `syslog` container over UDP.

----
docker run -d --link syslog:syslog wildfly-syslog
----

The `--link` switch will create environment variables based on what
the `syslog` container is exposing, and it exposes the `514` UDP
port. Docker will create the `SYSLOG_PORT_514_UDP_ADDR`
environment variable (and many others) for us which will tell us the IP where
the syslog container is running.
The link:https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerlinks/[Docker links
feature] if a great way to make containers talk to each other without
hardcoding the connection parameters.

=== Accessing logs

In the above example we still log everything to files. If you would like to receive
them from the `syslog` container you can use a similar method as described in the
link:#_getting_access_to_the_logs[Getting access to the logs] section above.

== Summary

As you can see, logging in a container can be easy and powerful at the same
time. You need to choose the best option for you. There is no golden mean.

I hope this blog post will help you manage your logs. If you have ny ideas on how to
make the logging easier with the `jboss/wildfly` image, feel free to leave a
